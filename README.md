# Astro stuff

This blog is powered by Astro - see [Astro documentation](https://docs.astro.build) and [Discord server](https://astro.build/chat).

## ðŸš€ Project Structure

Inside of your Astro project, you'll see the following folders and files:

```
â”œâ”€â”€ public/
â”œâ”€â”€ src/
â”‚Â Â  â”œâ”€â”€ components/
â”‚Â Â  â”œâ”€â”€ content/
â”‚Â Â  â”œâ”€â”€ layouts/
â”‚Â Â  â””â”€â”€ pages/
â”œâ”€â”€ astro.config.mjs
â”œâ”€â”€ README.md
â”œâ”€â”€ package.json
â””â”€â”€ tsconfig.json
```

Astro looks for `.astro` or `.md` or `.mdx` files in the `src/pages/` directory. Each page is exposed as a route based on its file name.

There's nothing special about `src/components/`, but that's where we like to put any Astro/React/Vue/Svelte/Preact components.

The `src/content/` directory contains "collections" of related Markdown and MDX documents.
Any static assets, like images, can be placed in the `public/` directory.

## ðŸ§ž Commands

All commands are run from the root of the project, from a terminal:

| Command                   | Action                                           |
| :------------------------ | :----------------------------------------------- |

| `npm run dev`             | Starts local dev server at `localhost:3000`      |
