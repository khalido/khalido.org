# About

ðŸ‘‹ once upon a time, blogs had about pages.

## Colophon

This website is built with:

- **Astro:** [https://astro.build/](https://astro.build/)
- **Tailwind CSS:** [https://tailwindcss.com](https://tailwindcss.com)
- **MDX:** [https://mdxjs.com/](https://mdxjs.com/)

It previously used an [overly complicated python script](https://github.com/khalido/blog/blob/master/bloggy/blog.py) I wrote, but it kept getting longer, so rather than spend time on the blog engine, using a tool like Astro makes it easier to just write.
