# About

Currently using this page to test `mdx`. This code should call a simple component and pass in two vars:

```html
<Test name="_passed_in_variable_", n=4 />
```

The actual component:

<Test name="_passed_in_variable_" n='4' />



## Colophon

This website runs on [Astro](https://astro.build/), and uses [tailwindcss](https://tailwindcss.com) and mdx.

It previously used an [overly complicated python script](https://github.com/khalido/blog/blob/master/bloggy/blog.py) I wrote, but it kept getting longer, so rather than spend time on the blog engine, using a tool like Astro makes it easier to just write.
