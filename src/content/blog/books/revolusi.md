We don't talk about Indonesia enough - it's the world's fourth most populous country and was the first colonized country to declare independence after WW2.

> The Revolusi - the Indonesian war of independence that began in 1945- was in every respect a youth revolution, supported and defended by a whole generation of fifteen- to twenty-five-year-olds who were willing to die for their freedom. Anyone who believes that young people cannot make a difference in the struggle against global warming and the loss of biodiversity needs to study Indonesian history now. The world's third-largest country would never have become independent without the work of people in their teens and early twenties - although I hope today's young climate activists will use less violent tactics.

> But above all, what makes the Revolusi so fascinating is its enor- mous impact on the rest of humanity. It shaped expectations about the nature of decolonisation: not a gradual, decades-long process of increasing autonomy, but a swift transition to independence. Not limited to one small portion of the colony, but affecting the entire territory. And not restricted to a few specific powers or ministries, but constituting a complete transfer of political sovereignty.
