cucumber + mint raita

## Ingredients

- 1-2 tsp cumin seeds
- pinch of chilli powder
- 1 big cucumber or 2 smallish
- 1-2 cup indian yoghurt (or more, whatever fits in your bowl)
- half a bunch worth of fresh mint leaves, chopped fine
- 1/2 tsp salt
- 1 chilli, chopped (optional, cause a good raita isn't too spicy, the food is.)
- Optional: a bit of fresh coriander, chopped 

## Steps

1. toast cumin seeds for 3-4 minutes in a hot pan, then grind with a mortar and pestle
2. grate half the cucumber and place in a bowl, dice the other half
3. add yoghurt, salt, and almost all the mint, cucumber, chilli and cumin and mix well
4. sprinkle remaining mint, cucumber, chilli and cumin on top and serve.

Goes well with biryani. Don't use any non-fresh powders in raita, a wise cook once told me. Simple is good. Resist the urge to add more things.
