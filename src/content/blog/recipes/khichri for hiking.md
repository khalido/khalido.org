# Khichri

This khichri recipe is modified for backpacking, at home this would include a bhaagar and a few different steps. Normally you would have a seperate pot for rinsing and soaking, and another one for frying, but here we have just the one larger pot and one smaller frypan.

## Ingredients

- 3/4 cup mixed dhal - a even mix of mung and masoor
- 3/4 cup basmati rice
- 1 tomatoes chopped
- 1 onion, diced
- 1-2 garlic
- a tiny bit of ginger
- 1 fresh chillis chopped (optional)
- 1/2 coriander, chopped

## Spice

- 1/4 tsp chilli 
- 1 tsp salt (1 tsp per cup of daal)
- 1/2 tsp of tumeric/haldi
- 1/4 tsp garam masala
- 1/2 tsp cumin seeds
- 1/4 tsp mustard seeds (optional)

## Directions

### In the pot
- rinse lentils + rice to a few times, then leave to soak for at least 30 minutes. 
- Put on low heat and start boiling. You want the water level just above the rice + lentils
- Add half the onion, 1/2 the garlic and all the tomato, stir through
- turn the heat up until close to boiling, then put it on low heat to simmer/cook. Optionally, cover with a lid.

The total cooking time... depends. Anywhere from 20-35 minutes.
### Frypan
Do this step about 20-30 minutes into the khichri being cooked.

- Fry onion on low to heat.
- Add garlic, fry for 20-30 seconds,
- turn down heat and add 1/2 the chilli and all the spices, stir for 20 seconds.
- Add this to the pot and stir away

Final step:
- Garnish with coriander and chilli.

Caution: Hiking pans are very thin and the garlic/spices can burn fast.
## Notes
- Camping stoves are hot and hiking pots are very thin, so its really easy to buy the spices.
- This assumes your have a seperate small frypan, if you don't, just chuck everything in the one pot and simmer, then add 1/2 onions and chilli and all the coriander at the end.
