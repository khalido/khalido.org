# Aloo Keema

Recipe in progress in an attempt to recreate a vegan version of homestyle aloo keema.

## Ingredients

- 350 gms vegan mince, soy/pea/wheat protein based
- 2 tomatoes diced
- 1 onion sliced and cut a bit more
- 2-3 green chilis, chopped (1-2 works too)
- 1 tsp garlic crushed
- 1 tsp ginger minced
- 1/2 tsp tamarind paste
- coriander, half bunch
- 2-3 medium potatoes, cubed medium small (1-2 is enough too)
- 1/2-1 tsp zeera (cumin seeds) 

### Spices

Spices vary a lot in different home style recipes. So long as you have chilli you can't really go wrong. Vegan mince needs spice to cover up its lack of flavour compared to actual meat. If using a closer to meat mine like 

- 1 tsp salt
- 1/4 tsp haldi (tumeric)
- 1/2 tsp chilli powder
- 1/4 tsp garam masala (optional)
- 1/4 tsp coriander powder (optional)
- ground black pepper, just a bit

## Steps

1. heat oil to medium, fry onions for 5-6 minutes, lower heat
2. Defrost mince for 60 seconds by in microwave on high. Doesn't need to be fully defrosted, partially is fine.
3. add in cumin seeds, fry for 1/2 minute
4. Add chilli, fry 1-2 minutes
5. Add garlic, ginger and tamarind paste, fry for a 1 minute
6. add spices, keep stirring slowly for 1-2 minutes
7. Add defrosted mince, stir in with spice mix for a minute, optionally grind a tiny bit of black pepper.
8. Add potatoes and stir slowly so everything is coated with the spices,  ~2-3 minutes.
9. Add tomatoes, stir through for 2 minutes
10. add 1/2 cup water then put a lid on, lower heat all the way. Leave for 8-10 minutes
11. remove lid, stir, put back on heat for 8-10 minutes more.
12. Check if potatoes soft enough to eat, and if so, you're done!
13. Add coriander, stir through and serve

Optional: Add chopped fresh ginger and chilli as garnish, serve with lemon or lime wedges. The dish 

This recipe feeds 3ish ppl. Makes good cold sandwiches the next day,

## Notes:

- try with 100-200g frozen peas
- garam masala yeah or nay?
- don't use tvp mince, it has a strong non-desi food taste
