A relational database is just a collection of 2d data tables. The relational part means is that these 2d tables are connected to one another by sharing a data field, e.g a CRM table and a orders table will both have a customer ID.

## Joins

join, or inner join - joins data found in both tables

However, we often have asymetric data in tables so:

- left join - keeps all rows from the left table
- right join - keeps all rows from the right table
- full join - all rows from both tables are kept

The basic query, to select all the things, limited for sanity:

```sql
select * from table limit 5
```

A basic select query looks like

```sql
SELECT Car, sum(domestic_sales + international_sales) AS total_sales,
FROM mytable
	-- only looking at Hondas
	WHERE Car like "Honda%"
	-- having is similar to where but used for group by
	GROUP BY widget HAVING continent = "Asia"
	ORDER BY total_sales DESC
	limit 5;
```

Subqueries is a piece of cake, just add brackets. The query inside the brackets resolves to the avg sale price of a widget, and we can now use that to filter for widgets which cost more than the avg sale price.

```sql
select * from widgets
where widget_cost >
	(select avg(sale_price)
	from wigets);
```
