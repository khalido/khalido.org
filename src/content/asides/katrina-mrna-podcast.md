The [Joe Walker podcast](https://josephnoelwalker.com/) has a [great inteview](https://josephnoelwalker.com/147-katalin-kariko/) with Katalin Karik√≥, one of the scientists/founders behind mRNA technology.

Some standouts in the coversation - the path from communist Hungary to US, not getting grant funding over and over again, a great explanation of mRNA, women in science... lots more.
